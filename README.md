# Trivia Game

This project involved generating a series of questions for the user to answer as well as generating results based on users inputs. In additon, a countdown timer was employed in which when the timer reached 0, results were displayed. The project involved a series of showing and hiding various components of the code for a fluid UI experience. Radio buttons were used to store user inputs in which they had to be evaluated at the end of the program as well as be cleared.
